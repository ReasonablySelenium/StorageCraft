# Contributing To StorageCraft

Thank you for providing your contributions to StorageCraft. In order to maintain a healthy development cycle for all developers, please follow the following guidelines. This also applies to issues posted on the Issues page of the GitHub.

1) Use Common Sense

Treat this mod as you would any other mod you contribute to. Respect other developers and treat others as you want to be treated.

2) Don't ask for a port to higher Minecraft Versions.

StorageCraft will not be updated to other versions other than 1.7.10. This mod is specifically designed for those who like to play Refined Storage but are looking for a backport. If you wish to play something like StorageCraft for 1.8 and above, please download Refined Storage instead, and honor the people that made this cool mod. (Perhaps donate to them if you can?)

3) Do not ask when this mod will be updated.

Code and releases will be released when it's ready. We work on this mod in our free time, and hate being nagged about when something is going to be released. Please consider contributing instead to speed up the process of releases. The more people that can work on this project, the faster and better the project will become.

4) We are not associated with Refined Storage.

As of the time of this document, we are not associated with the Refined Team. Please do not bother them with issues or complaints about our mod, as they'll likely just close your issue and ignore you. One person got his issue closed just for asking about backporting to 1.7.10.

5) Follow all guidelines and regulations.

Follow all of the appropriate guidelines and regulations for this repository, this website, and applicable laws/regulations based in the United States.
